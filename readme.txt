Using what we just learned, create a Note Manager Application where you can add, edit and delete a note. Make sure that this app uses AJAX and also has the correct error validation as well! Use the wireframe below as a visual guide.  

We see the following 5 forms that need to be on the web page for the above example.

A form for updating the note information (title, description) for the 'Django' note - note that there is no 'button' to submit this form, but that's okay. We'll initially have this 'Update' button in our app and update our information using this 'button' and once we get Ajax working just hide this 'Update' button. Now ask yourself what information would you need to include in this form? Title, Description, and maybe the ID of the note that was created???
A form for deleting the note information for the 'Django' note - now ask yourself what information would you need to include in this form? Maybe the id of the note that was created???
A form for updating the note information (title, description) for the Python note.
A form for deleting the note information for the 'Python' note.
A form for creating a new note - now what information should you have in this form
